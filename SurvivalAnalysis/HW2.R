# HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT:
# Provide a follow-up to your last report and a set of recommendations summarizing the findings from your analysis.
# For this analysis, you will only focus on one type of failure-flood, so you will use reason instead of survive as your
# status variable, treating everything that didn't fail due to flooding as censored.1 In SAS, you can specify multiple
# censoring codes by separating them with commas: hour*reason(0, 2, 3, 4). In R, use Surv(time = hour, event
#                                                                                         = reason == 1). This new report should include the following information:
#   . Create an AFT model with the following variables: backup, bridgecrane, servo, trashrack, elevation,
# slope, age. Don't worry about interactions for now.
# . Fit this model with the exponential, Weibull, log-normal, and log-logistic distributions and discuss the possible
# distribution of the data.
# . Once you have chosen a distribution, provide the coefficient estimates and standard errors from your model
# and comment on anything that you find interesting. You must interpret a few of them (at least one categorical
#                                                                                      and one continuous).
# . The Army Corps of Engineers only has enough time and money to upgrade 20 pumps. Choose an upgrade for
# 20 pumps (one upgrade per pump); you can decide this however you'd like, but explain why you've recommended
# those 20. You don't have to give one explanation for every individual pump, just state any overarching
# reasons for upgrading the particular set of pumps that you chose.
